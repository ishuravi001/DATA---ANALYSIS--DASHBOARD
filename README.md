# CALL CENTRE DATA ANALYSIS (Interactive Dashboard using MS Excel)
## Project Objective
The objective of this project is to create an interactive call centre dashboard that summarizes key performance metrics such as calls, revenue, ratings, customers, and call duration. The dashboard helps track trends, compare agent and regional performance, and support quick, data-driven decision-making to improve efficiency and customer satisfaction.

## Dataset Used

## KPI Questions
-	How many total calls were received during the selected period? 
-	What is the total revenue generated from calls? 
-	What is the average customer rating and how does it change over time? 
-	Which months show the highest and lowest call volumes?
-	On which days of the week do we receive the most calls?
-	Which regions (Cincinnati, Cleveland, Columbus) generate the highest calls and revenue?
-	What is the male vs female caller distribution by region?
-	Which representatives (R01–R05) handle the most calls and generate the highest revenue?
-	What is the total and average call duration?
-	How many unique customers were served during the period?

  ## Process
-	 Collect call centre data from source files (e.g., Excel).
-	Clean and prepare the data by removing errors and standardizing formats.
-	Identify key KPIs such as calls, revenue, ratings, and duration.
-	Create visualizations (charts, cards, tables) for each KPI.
-	Add filters and interactivity for regions and representatives.
-	Design and arrange the dashboard layout for clarity and readability.
-	Validate results and publish the dashboard for user analysis.
